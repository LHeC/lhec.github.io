# The Large Hadron-electron Collider at CERN (LHeC)
The Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC) is designed to move the field of deep inelastic scattering (DIS) to the energy and intensity frontier of particle physics.
This website collects a few links and references to relevant articles, workhops and conferences.

Official LHeC website is hosted at [lhec.web.cern.ch](https://lhec.web.cern.ch).
